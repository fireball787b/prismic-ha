When you're ready to start your project, run the following command:

```sh
npm run dev
```
## Unit/Integration:
npm run test

## E2E with cypress
npx cypress run

## Relations
the project consists of monsters and products: each monster could have from 0 to many related products for taking care of them

## Use of generative AI
almost all the project has been generated using ai tools. the exception are the interfaces (types folder). it generated all the code tests under my
detailed instructions. Also helped me somehow to resolve some problems with the code. nonetheless, at certain point it started to allucinate and repeated
the same mistake disguised as a solution. Had to search on google to find the solution.
